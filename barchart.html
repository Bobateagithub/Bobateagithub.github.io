    <h2>Other Coding Skills</h2>
    <p>I have not only learnt code but others maybe useful things like filing the files so then I can actually use the images, trying to make my code actually neat but havent got much big and heavy projects yet.</p>

    <div class="info2">
      <h2>Cooking</h2>
    <p>I would say I'm not that great at the actual cooking skills but I have learnt some of the basics of cooking you know salt fat heat and positioning of the food that could apply at resturants because ussually whats in the middle is the star of the show.
    </p>
    <p>I'm more of a supporter in the kitchen so it's like I'm going from a supporter to a chef or in other words like a sentinel to duelist.</p>
