<div class="about">
    <p>Hey. Whats up my name is Kevin I like to game,code,cook and more! I am in secondary school and yeah. My favourite pet is probaly a cat. I am also intersested in game making. I started coding somewhere near the start of October.It has been interesting so far with now my 12 years of experience. I feel quite unsure of what I want from life you know the thing is getting lamborghinis and a mansion is not just life there is meaning, a meaning we deserve to give ourselves I'll finish off with a quote.“The idea is not to live forever, it is to create something that will.” or is it "You need the thing that would ordinarily bore you to suddenly thrill you."-Andy Warhol.Consider this website a museam.</p>

                    <p>I mean I guess it is done now right? I mean you are seeing this right now so yeah consider this project done. It has been quite the interesting journey doing a lot of things like colour palletes and actually learning the basics of code for the first time in my life. I had barely touched scratch or JS the only reason its "30%" in my barchart was to kind of expirement with code, I barely understand Javascript though. </p>

                    <p>I had aways thought about this and have longed to create a game. I had watched videos, tutorials and had some drops of curiosity about the industry of game making I saw things like unreal engine, unity and godot. I plan for the game to have touches of other adventurous, building and action games. I plan for servers with each different people that are assigned to a kind of team in the whole server through a survey. The team that wins is decided from the players. Watch out there could be dev pirates raiding bases! ! This project will be later in the future!</p>

        <h2>A letter and Kevin</h2>
        <p> For the people that has wandered to my  page of things about me, I am Kevin and these are some of my deep thoughts
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Every person has obssesion and very deep thoughts that people get from somewhere. My thoughts feelings and obsessions have done me some good so far. The thing is some people mostly children might nt see their inner important thoughts like dreams and that maybe obsessions ;ead to the success of dreams. People might be so obssesed with their dream they might think that if they had a button infront of them right now that would make their dream come true but kill the peson that pressed it. The thing is, its more important to see your true dream have a mansion and cars are not true dreams its more what you find interesting.
            <br>
            Now where was I?
            <br>
            <br>
            Yes,the code I have done has all gone into this website.I was using HTML and CSS maybe more but yeah.You know the thing is I'm not much of a writer but here I am, writing.Or not while I think I might as well just wander to my brain and just think of random stuff like how long it has taken me to build this website ground up with absolutely no help (Such a lie).
            By the time I properly finish this website I don't know what to do but its so .... dead.I sometimes wander into the deep thought of cycles and more on that if you press the button below.
